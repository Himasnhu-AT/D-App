## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate the responsible disclosure 
of such issues. If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, please 
report it to us promptly. We kindly request that you follow these steps:

1. **Email**: Send an email to [To Be Updaate] with a detailed description of the
    vulnerability. Please encrypt sensitive information using our PGP key (if available).

2. **Expectations**: You can expect to receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24
   hours. We will then work to confirm the vulnerability and its impact on our project.

3. **Resolution**: Our security team will strive to respond to and address the vulnerability
   promptly. Once the issue is confirmed and resolved, we will release a security patch or update.

4. **Disclosure**: After the vulnerability has been resolved and a patch is available, we will
   coordinate with you to disclose the issue. We greatly appreciate responsible disclosure and
   may not credit you as of now for your assistance (but soon).

5. **Updates**: We will keep you informed about the progress of the vulnerability resolution and
    any updates to the project's status.

## Scope

Please note that this security policy applies only to vulnerabilities related to the project's codebase 
and infrastructure. It does not cover security issues in third-party libraries or dependencies. We 
recommend reporting such issues directly to the maintainers of the affected software.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure.
